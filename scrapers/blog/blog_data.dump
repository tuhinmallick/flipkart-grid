Now he and the French design house have taken things one step further, by unveiling a jewellery collaboration with one of France’s most celebrated 20th century artists, César Baldaccini. The artist, more commonly known simply as César (1921-1998), was a member of the Nouveau réalisme movement. He is most famous for his 1960s “Compression” series, in which towering sculptures were formed from cars and scrap metal. In the ’70s, he miniaturised the concept by taking broken but treasured bits of old gold jewellery from friends and and giving them new life, compressing them into pendants on long chains that could be worn and played with as memory-filled talismans. Today, Carine Roitfeld is rarely pictured without her vintage César pendant, which matches the giant sculpture by the artist she has at home. For autumn/winter 2020, Celine has collaborated with Fondation César to recreate those pendants in a limited run of 100 gold vermeil and 100 silver pieces that ties in perfectly with the collection’s bourgeois theme. Stéphanie Busuttil-Janssen, who was César's partner for the last decade of his life and is president of the foundation, says the collaboration was a perfect match up that came together just two months before the catwalk presentation. “Celine approached us and it just felt so current,” she says. “There’s a kind of ’70s glamorous bourgeoisie decadence in the fashion, which is very close to the César spirit.” César himself was no stranger to fashion. He counted designers Azzedine Alaïa and Yves Saint Laurent among his friends and collectors, and himself collaborated with Louis Vuitton and Alaïa. For Busuttil-Janssen, the Celine project is the perfect way to honour his memory and keep his legacy alive. “César loved fashion and with this project, we can reflect what he represented and reach a completely new audience,” she explains. No detail, she says, was overlooked in the making of the edition, with Slimane and his team working closely with the foundation to keep true to the spirt of the original. The mould was based on an actual César pendant and then resized by artisanal craftspeople specially for Celine. The new version, which can also be displayed as a sculpture, even comes in a pine box, just as César's would have done. “It’s a jewel with power, with attitude,” says Busuttil–Janssen. And who can say they don’t need one of those?

Models turned heads on Valentino’s spring/summer 2020 runway, gliding along in pristine white braided footwear, and the shoes have since cropped up on the feeds of pretty much every stylish influencer. JW Anderson also drew inspiration from Ancient Rome for his spring/summer 2020 showcase – the Northern Irish designer presented braided sandals dripping with crystals and striped ribbon, while Maria Grazia Chiuri of Christian Dior accessorised her bohemian dresses with woven raffia footwear. Lockdown conditions likely played a part in the spiralling popularity of rope sandals, which couldn’t be comfier, but can still pep up your grocery dash. When it comes to the fashion pack’s favourite flats, they’re second only to Chanel’s quilted leather velcro sandals – a firm favourite of Rosie Huntington-Whiteley’s – and the Maison’s cord rope style has also acquired much cachet of late.

With a white tee, the styling possibilities are endless – hence its position in the pantheon of wardrobe greats. It has had more than a few memorable Hollywood moments, too, and not just on women. Would Rebel Without a Cause have been Rebel Without a Cause without James Dean’s white T-shirt? Below, 11 ways to maximise your favourite white T-shirt’s style potential. Combine ice, ivory and creamy whites for maximum impact. “I love a cut that’s roomy and gently oversized, with square-shaped short sleeves and a relatively high neckline,” says British Vogue’s deputy editor and fashion features director (and noted white T-shirt fan), Sarah Harris. A white T-shirt doesn’t have to be casual – wear with understated tailoring for an elevated look. Flashes of white with an otherwise all-neutral palette is a fresh twist on the beige-on-beige look that has become ubiquitous at fashion week. The white T-shirt has been a staple of the off-duty model’s wardrobe since the genesis of the supers. Cindy Crawford, Brooke Shields and Christy Turlington all wore them with their denim shorts in the ’90s – the epitome of all-American appeal. Adding a fitted white tee will ensure the attention stays on your head-turning statement prints. A leather jacket over a white tee looked good when Danny Zuko did it, and it will when you do it, too. A smarter alternative to denim that offers a crucial hint of edge. Boyish tailored blazers and a crisp white tee are a match made in heaven. Throw on some vibrant outwear and add colour pop accessories to energise what could be a workaday look. By all means wear party-ready sparkles, but avoid any suggestion of trying too hard by adding a white T-shirt underneath.

Remember Kate Moss’s Primrose Hill days, when she swaggered around west London in a uniform of skinny jeans, Saint Laurent blazer, and discreet flats? A pair of black Repetto bowed pumps were the supermodel’s go-to back in the Noughties, and the handbag-friendly shoe (slim enough to stash for an end-of-the-night switch-up), is back. Of course, the pump never truly went away. Chanel’s two-tone ballet flats have been a staple for fashion editors, actors and models for decades. Gabrielle “Coco” Chanel first created her distinctive beige and black slingbacks in 1957, adding the signature contrasting toe cap to give the illusion of longer, slimmer legs. The designer is said to have hated her own feet, a hang-up that inspired her to create a shoe that was elegant yet practical. The actors Gina Lollobrigida and Romy Schneider were fans of the two-tone style, and new iterations of the classic shoe appear on the Chanel catwalk every season. Still, the ballet pump has had a lengthy hiatus from fashion’s front-lines, briefly interrupted by Daniel Lee, who included it in his debut autumn/winter 2019 collection for Bottega Veneta. Shortly after taking the helm, the British designer reimagined the pump in an angular, structured style that swiftly became a hit with his staunch following.

The dad-esque chunky grey trainers are a favourite of Kaia Gerber – who wore them throughout fashion month – while Rihanna prefers the brand’s sleeker 574 shape.

A fancy ruffled blouse may not be the most quarantine-friendly trend for you at this time, so perhaps consider a flattering top to do the talking. Pair with layered gold chains or some conversation-starting earrings (see below) to add some extra pizzazz. Cast aside any preconceptions you may have of the Bermuda short – it is your new summer go-to. Gone are the Hawaiian printed, knee-swinging pairs that are a favourite among Dads (not in a cool way), and enter the new iterations in leather, silk and candy colours. A pair of structured, crisp sandals are not only super stylish, but brilliantly practical. Add some boost to a simple summer flip flop with a tan leather style from The Row, or consider Jil Sander’s crossover pair for some subtle detail. Even if dangling your legs out the window is the closest you’re getting the great “outdoors” this summer, why not treat yourself to some clean-cut bikinis to bask in? Plus, a colourful one-shoulder top looks great under a slightly sheer white summer dress (see below). Some of us are living in them, some of us wouldn’t be seen dead in them. Thanks to quarantine, sweatpants have witnessed a second coming, not to mention a luxe makeover. Rihanna famously accessorises hers with heels, while Rosie Huntington-Whiteley proves that you shouldn’t shy away from the full tracksuit. A throw-on dress is the ideal beachside to poolside-to-dinner-table item. Your dress’s journey may only involve the latter at the moment, but don’t let that stop you from realising its full potential once freedom beckons. When the climes get warmer, this is all you’ll want to be wearing. With the “new normal” and working-from-home situation, comes new style codes. Video conference jewellery is the latest trend among those who partake in regular calls to colleagues, family or friends. They’re one way of nailing “waist-up” dressing in one bold, effortless sweep.

The shorts suit in question sauntered down the spring/summer 2020 runway last September, to a soundtrack of Princess Nokia: “That girl is a tomboy!” Cut long on the leg, and equally lean in the collarless jacket, it was inspired by outgoing artistic director Clare Waight Keller’s memories of her move from London to New York in 1993, and the “raw, boyish energy” that surrounded the self-professed tomboy. The suit was worn with chunky tan slides, a turquoise cocktail ring and a clutch bag. But also with nothing underneath.

Cast aside memories of short-shorts and a cropped blazer (remember in the 2000s when we thought that felt flirty?) as well as tailored brocade two-pieces (very Orange County graduation ceremony), and instead embrace the youthful breeziness born of elongated proportions. For further details, see Tod’s, where a chocolate satin exemplar paired with flat leather sandals comprised a standout look; Max Mara, where multiple shorts suits felt faintly militaristic (fear not: you can lose the long socks and the Villanelle ties when wearing IRL); and Bottega Veneta, where the two-pieces looked characteristically sleek paired with powder-blue mules. “Shorts suits strike a balance between seriousness and fun. I like that there’s room for play,” says Yoyo Cao, the Singapore-based entrepreneur with a penchant for the Bermuda cut. She has several co-ordinating sets, with a Bottega Veneta version being her favourite. As for advice on how to tackle the trend, she counsels: “It’s really a moment for footwear to take centre-stage. I usually wear mine with a statement pair of heels or knee-high boots.” Drawing the eye to a skinny ankle seems key to pulling off a long pair of shorts. So, too, picking a high-waisted shape that balances out a long-line blazer, with a streamlined layer underneath. Of course, you may prefer, like Natalie Kingham, to steer clear of them entirely. “Historically, I think Bermuda shorts can be difficult for a lot of women, unless you are very tall, or have the attitude to pull them off,” the fashion and buying director of Matchesfashion.com laughs. “That said, tailored shorts have always performed incredibly well for us – Valentino and Chloé do brilliantly flattering, slightly shorter styles. I like wearing, say, a cream pair of shorts with an oversized navy blazer. That feels a bit more preppy, and is easier to pull off.” If the boyish vibe isn’t your thing, channel Mona von Bismarck, the Kentucky girl turned New York high-society phenomenon. Habitually dripping in couture, the countess also asked Cristóbal Balenciaga to create bespoke pairs of tailored gardening shorts (in white linen, no less) for her green-fingered forays in the garden of her Capri villa, where she tended to her prize- winning tulips.

But – since Mona wore her shorts with slim-line navy sweaters and striped espadrilles, and accessorised with several small curly haired dogs and a wicker cuttings basket – we feel sure she would approve of dainty sandals with the trend. See? Shorts suddenly aren’t sounding so frightening after all.
